## Reporting a Vulnerability

Team Lens encourages users who become aware of a security vulnerability in Lens to contact Team Lens with details of the vulnerability. Team Lens has established an email address that should be used for reporting a vulnerability. Please send descriptions of any vulnerabilities found to security@k8slens.dev. Please include details on the software and hardware configuration of your system so that we can duplicate the issue being reported.

Team Lens hopes that users encountering a new vulnerability will contact us privately as it is in the best interests of our users that Team Lens has an opportunity to investigate and confirm a suspected vulnerability before it becomes public knowledge.

In the case of vulnerabilities found in third-party software components used in Lens, please also notify Team Lens as described above.
