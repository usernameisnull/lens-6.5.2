## The Repository

This repository is where Team Lens develops the core of the [Lens Desktop](https://k8slens.dev) product together with the community.

The core is a library, powered by [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/). Unlike generic Electron + React frameworks / boilerplates, it is very opinionated for creating Lens Desktop-like applications and has support for Lens Extensions.

In the future, this library will be streamlined to become more customizable and pluggable with easy to use tooling for Lens Extension developers.

This source code is available to everyone under the [MIT license](./LICENSE).

## Lens Desktop

[Lens Desktop](https://k8slens.dev) is built on top of the Lens Desktop Core with Team Lens built extensions released under a traditional [Terms Of Service](https://k8slens.dev/licenses/tos).

Lens Desktop is a standalone application for MacOS, Windows and Linux operating systems. Get started by downloading it from [Lens website](https://k8slens.dev).
